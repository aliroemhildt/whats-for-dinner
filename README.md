# What's for Dinner?

An app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

## Overview

When the page loads, users will see three options for types of recipes: side, main dish, and desert. After selecting the recipe type that they are interested in, a "let's cook" button will appear. When a user clicks the "let's cook" button, a random recipe of that type will appear on the right side of the page. A new random recipe will appear each time the "let's cook" button is clicked. The user can click the "clear" button on the right side of the page to remove the recipe from view and deselect the button for that recipe type.
